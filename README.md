# Seo Results Script
This script is configured to work in conjunction with a Divi Contact Form module to retrieve and display SEO Results. As the script is developed, I'll add more information here pertaining to configuring this script and deploying it.

## Configuration
  1. First, create a Divi Contact Form module. You can add as many fields as you like, however, one field must collect a domain name from the user. The ID for this field must be `DomainName`.
  2. Create a Divi code module, and add it anywhere on the page. Copy and paste the code (below) into the code section of the module.
```
<script>
  // I'm about to put cool stuff here!
</script>
```
